    <p>By string object (using new keyword)</p>
    <p>The new String() method in JavaScript is used to create a new String object. While it can be used to create a
        string, it
        is not commonly recommended or necessary in most scenarios. In JavaScript, strings can be created simply by
        using string
        literals (e.g., "hello").

        Here are some points to consider regarding the new String() method:

        Object-oriented approach: The new String() method allows you to create a String object, which means you can
        utilize
        string-related properties and methods available on the String object prototype. However, for most string
        operations,
        using string literals is simpler and more common.

        Immutability: String objects created with new String() are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed
        once they
        are created. However, JavaScript automatically converts string literals into string objects when necessary,
        allowing you
        to access string methods on literals as well.

        Type coercion: When using new String(), you are explicitly creating an object of type String. This can lead to
        unexpected behavior when comparing or using the string in operations, as JavaScript performs type coercion to
        convert
        the String object back to a primitive string when needed. This can differ from the behavior of string literals,
        which
        are already primitive strings.

        In most cases, using string literals ("hello") is sufficient and more convenient. String literals are
        lightweight and
        behave as expected in most operations. The new String() method is typically used in specific situations that
        require
        explicit String objects or when working with specific string-related methods available on the String object
        prototype.

<script>
    var stringname = new String("hello javascript string");
    console.log(typeof (stringname));
    console.log(stringname);

    let Str = "abdg"
    console.log(stringname.valueOf())

    const s1 = "2 + 2"; // creates a string primitive
    const s2 = new String("2 + 2"); // creates a String object
    console.log(eval(s1)); // returns the number 4
    console.log(eval(s2)); // returns the string "2 + 2"
    console.log(eval(s2.valueOf())); // returns the number 4
