    <h3>all functions are frist class function bcz sometimes we do not use functions like variable or return inside
        another function but that function still has captity to do so.

        A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like
        any other
        variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be
        returned
        by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

    function greeting(helloMessage, name) { //Passing a function as an argument
        console.log(helloMessage() + name);
    }
    // Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
    greeting(sayHello, "JavaScript!");
    // Hello, JavaScript!
