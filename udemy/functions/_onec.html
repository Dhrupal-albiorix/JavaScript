    <div>
        The function that is passed to the _.once() function adds 10 to the variable 10 which originally has 10 value.
        Then the
        _.once() function is assigned to the another function ‘startFunc()’. Then the first time the ‘startFunc()’ is
        called the
        value of ‘a’ is incremented by 10 and becomes 20. So the output of first time calling is 20. Then the next time
        when
        ‘startFunc()’ is called the value of ‘a’ is again supposed to be incremented by 10 but this does not happen.
        This is
        because the ‘startFunc()’ has a function ‘_.once()’ in its definition which prevents it from being executed more
        than
        one times. So, the output of the second and third calls will be the same as first, i.e., 20. On the first line,
        the
        value of ‘a’ is getting printed before calling the ‘startFunc()’ hence the output is 10.

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var a = 10;

        function add() {
            a += 10;
        }
        var startFunc = _.once(add); //op : 10 , 20 , 20 , 20
        //  var startFunc = add; //op : 10 , 20 ,30 , 40
        console.log(a);
        startFunc();
        console.log(a);
        startFunc();
        console.log(a);
        startFunc();
        console.log(a);
