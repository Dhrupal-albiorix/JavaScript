    // A recursive function is a function that calls itself until it doesnâ€™t.And this technique is called recursion.
    // A recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself.Otherwise, 
    // it will call itself indefinitely.So a recursive function typically looks like the following:

    function countDown(fromNumber) {
        console.log(fromNumber);

        let nextNumber = fromNumber - 1;

        if (nextNumber > 0) {
            countDown(nextNumber);
        }
    }
    countDown(3);
