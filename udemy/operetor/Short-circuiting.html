<body>

    <p>In the previous section, we said "the higher-precedence expressions are always evaluated first" — this is
        generally
        true, but it has to be amended with the acknowledgement of short-circuiting, in which case an operand may not be
        evaluated at all.

        Short-circuiting is jargon for conditional evaluation. For example, in the expression a && (b + c), if a is
        falsy, then
        the sub-expression (b + c) will not even get evaluated, even if it is grouped and therefore has higher
        precedence than
        &&. We could say that the logical AND operator (&&) is "short-circuited". Along with logical AND, other
        short-circuited
        operators include logical OR (||), nullish coalescing (??), and optional chaining (?.).</p>

<script>
    function A() { console.log('called A'); return false; }
    function B() { console.log('called B'); return false; }
    function C() { console.log('called C'); return true; }

    console.log(C() || B() && A());

    // Logs:
    // called C
    // true
    console.log("Only C() is evaluated, despite && having higher precedence. This does not mean that || has higher precedence in this case — it's exactly because (B() && A()) has higher precedence that causes it to be neglected as a whole")
