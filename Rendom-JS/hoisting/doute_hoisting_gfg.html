        In this code snippet, the variable `x` is declared and assigned a value of 10 outside the `test()` function.
        Let's go
        through the code step by step:
        <br>

        1. `var x = 10;`: The variable `x` is declared and assigned a value of 10 in the global scope.
        <br>

        2. `function test() { ... }`: The `test()` function is defined.
        <br>

        3. `console.log(x);`: The first `console.log` statement inside the `test()` function attempts to log the value
        of `x`.
        However, since there is a variable named `x` declared within the function scope, it shadows the global variable
        `x`. bcx var is not block scop , it will ignore {} scop . (var has function and globle scop only , not block
        scop)At
        this point, the local variable `x` has not been assigned any value, so it is `undefined`. Therefore, the output
        of this
        statement will be `undefined`.
        <br>

        4. `if (x > 20) { var x = 50; }`: This `if` statement checks if the local variable `x` (which is still
        `undefined`) is
        greater than 20. Since the condition is not met, the code block inside the `if` statement is not executed.
        <br>

        5. `console.log(x);`: The second `console.log` statement inside the `test()` function attempts to log the value
        of `x`.
        At this point, the local variable `x` has not been assigned any value within the `test()` function. Therefore,
        it
        remains `undefined`. The output of this statement will also be `undefined`.
        <br>

        6. `test();`: Finally, the `test()` function is called, which triggers the execution of the code inside the
        function.
        <br>

        So, the output of running this code will be:
        <br>
        ```
        undefined
        <br>
        undefined
        <br>
        ```

        Both `console.log` statements inside the `test()` function will output `undefined` because the local variable
        `x`
        shadows the global variable `x` and is not assigned any value before being logged.

    var x = 10;
    function test() {
        console.log(x) //undefine
        if (x > 20) {
            var x = 50;
        }

        console.log(x);
    }
    test();



            // var x = 10;
            // function test() {
            //     console.log(x)
            //     if (x > 20) {
            //          x = 50; //do not reinitilize and all problem are solved , as now hoisting will not be repated.
            //     }

            //     console.log(x);
            // }
