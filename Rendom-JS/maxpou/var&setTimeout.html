        I like this one because it's a bit trickier and it deals with scope and the JavaScript Event Loop.
        <br>
        The classic pitfall here is the Zero delays. setTimeout(callback, 0) doesn’t mean that the callback will be fire
        after
        zero milliseconds.
        <br>
        Here's what happens on the event loop side:
        <br>
        Current Call Stack is set to the first setTimeout().<br>
        windows.setTimeout() is considered as a Web APIs (for better Non-Blocking I/O).<br> So the call stack sends this
        part of the
        code to correct Web APIs. After 0 milliseconds, the callback (here an anonymous function) would be sent to the
        Queue
        (not to the call stack).<br>
        As the call stack is free, for-loop can continue to the second setTimeout …(repeat after we meet this condition
        i < 4)… <br>Now the loop is over and i===4. JS can now execute the callback queue one by one. Each
            console.log(i) will print the
            4.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        switch to let keyword (instead of var) ,makes scope a bit more easy to understand.

    </div>
</body>

<script>
    for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        setTimeout(() => console.log(i, "using var"), 0)
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        setTimeout(() => console.log(i, "using let"), 0)
    }
</script>
