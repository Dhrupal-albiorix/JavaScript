        The previous code return undefined. Why? Looks, on the first let condition, we define an object with 2
        attributes (name
        and the function sayName()). Then on the second let, we have sayName2 which is a function into
        another
        variable. And then, we call this variable out of her context (in the global one).
        <br>
        as dog.sayName has its object contex but we are calling it in globle contex by storing object in varable outside
        object
        <br>
        The function sayName() will
        return
        window.name (global if the environment is Node). And typeof window.name === "undefined".
